Prezados,

a Plos One enviou um e-mail da aceitação do nosso artivo e foi feito o questionamento abaixo:

"2. Author Pedro R. D. Marinho is listed as Pedro Rafael Marinho in the online submission form; author Gauss M.Cordeiro is listed as Gauss Moutinho Coreiro in the online submission form; we are unsure which version is correct. If the name is incorrect in the manuscript, please correct this. If the name is incorrect in the submission form, please let us know so we can correct the author’s profile for you.  Please note that the use of middle initials/names should be consistent among the manuscript’s author list, the author list in the submission form, and the Author Contributions initials."

Respondendo ao questionamento, gostaria que fosse modificado os nomes dos autores no formulário online. Tanto no formulário online de submissão quanto no paper os nomes deverão ser:

1. Pedro Rafael D. Marinho
2. Rodrigo B. Silva
3. Marcelo Bourguignon
4. Gauss M. Cordeiro
5. Saralees Nadarajah

As modificações já foram realizadas no artigo que será modificado, bastando ser apenas atualizado o formulário online de submissão.
